# http-signature

This is an internal library for parsing and verifying signatures on requests to server-to-server API endpoints from federated ActivityPub servers. It mostly follows [the Cavage version of the HTTP Signature RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-cavage-http-signatures). This library was forked from [`@peertube/http-signature`](https://github.com/Chocobozzz/node-http-signature), which itself was forked from [the reference implementation by Joyent](https://github.com/joyent/node-http-signature).
